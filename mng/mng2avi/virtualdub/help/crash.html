While reading the context dump, please note the following:</p> <ul> <li>The analysis is not always correct. Sometimes a failure causes the CPU to go off into nowhere and the analyzer reports misleading information.</li> <li>VirtualDub reports the immediate cause of the crash, but that may not always indicate the true cause, if the failure is delayed.</li> <li>Third-party drivers can cause VirtualDub to crash. This includes capture drivers, video codecs, and audio codecs.</li></ul> <p> VirtualDub produces a crash dump file (<tt>crashinfo.txt</tt>) that can be of help to the program author when diagnosing a crash, as noted in the crash dialog. However, before submitting a crash dump, please attempt the following diagnosis steps:</p> <ul> <li><em>Upgrade to the latest version of VirtualDub if one is available.</em> Newer versions almost always fix bugs. The <em>Help | Change Log...</em> menu option will tell you what fixes have been applied.</li> <li><em>Try to reproduce it.</em> Crashes that only happen once aren't fixable.</li> <li><em>Remove third-party drivers.</em> If you are using audio and video codecs, try using no codec at all and see if it makes a difference. Third-party codecs are the #1 cause of crashes within VirtualDub and it is very helpful if you can identify the codec as a trigger, so that the root cause of the problem is more easily found. Also, please attempt to update to the latest version of any drivers, as the bug you are experiencing may already have been fixed. <table border=0 cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 style="padding: 1px; margin: 16px 0px"> <tr> <td style="padding-right: 20px"><span style="border: 0 solid red; border-bottom-width: 1px">Note</span></td> <td width="*"> If VirtualDub's context info tells you that an instruction not supported by your CPU was executed in a particular codec, while that codec was being used, 99.9% of the time the cause is the codec not properly checking your CPU before executing optimized code. VirtualDub does not have control over this and you must consult the codec manufacturer for technical support in this case. Make sure your CPU meets the stated minimum requirements for that codec.</td></tr></table></li> <li><em>Determine if a particular setting is implicated.</em> If a particular filter is needed to trigger the crash, I need to know that.</li> <li><em>Check your input.</em> Many crashes in codecs are caused by AVI files being damaged during transmission over the Internet. Suspect this has occurred if you are consistently getting crashes on a particular video frame.</li> <li><em>Un-overclock and check system temperature.</em> A rare, but nasty, case of crashes is an overclocked CPU, or worse, an overheated CPU (frozen fans are not unheard of). If you are overclocking, please attempt to downclock to the correct speeds for your CPU and motherboard before reporting a crash.</li></ul></td></tr></table></body></html>
