Hello,

I have created a program which converts a mng file into a series of png
images along with a VirtualDub script to convert the png images into
an AVI movie. 

The program first takes the mng file and splits it out into the series
of png images. As it does this, it checks for an attract mode loop. If it
finds a loop, the program will create the VirtualDub script and then
terminate.

The loop detection can be disabled by using the -movieloops 0 option in
the command line call to mng2avi.exe or by passing movieloops 0 in the
mng2avi.ini file.

I also have a batch file which takes a source mng file, a destination
avi file to be created, and an optional .wav file, and creates the
.avi file by calling the mng2avi program and VirtualDub.

The encoding used to create the avi file is controlled by the -movieaudio
and -movievideo parameters to the mng2avi program.

This program uses the public domain zlib library. I also thieved some of the
data structures and png handling functions from MAME.

This program uses the free VirtualDub program, which is at
http://www.virtualdub.org.

I have also enclosed a useful video codec. If your movie files are extremely
large, try running -movievideo 3 after installing the xvid codec.

If you want to build from sources, first run make from the src\zlib directory,
then run make from this directory.

Lastly, I've enclosed a copy of the LAME MP3 codec. Installation instructions are at:

Please contact me with any problems or suggestions.
