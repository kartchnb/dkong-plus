======================================================================
1. Trial Period and Registration
======================================================================

This product is copyrighted shareware, not public-domain software. You
may use the unregistered version at no charge for an evaluation period
of 30 days only. To continue to use the software beyond the 30-day
evaluation period, you must register it.

The "must" in the previous paragraph is a legal and moral must, not an
engineering must. This software is not time limited in any way. When
you register you eliminate the registration reminder, and gain one or
two extra features ("CMP /? | more" for details).

To register, see "How to Pay" below.

======================================================================
2. Registration Categories
======================================================================

  2.1  Individual Registration
  
Individual registration at the current price, as shown on the Web site
<http://oakroadsystems.com/sharware/>, entitles one user to use
CMP forever, both the current release and any future releases;
see "Upgrades", below. It also gives priority in response to questions
or bug reports.

Feel free to install CMP on multiple computers that you use
regularly, provided that no more than one of those computers is in use
at any one time and no other person will be making significant use of
it on those computers. (If several people will be using CMP,
please see "Site License" immediately below for discounts.)

You may make copies of the registered version of CMP for backup
or archival use, but you may not give copies to anyone else.

  2.2  Site License
  
A company or other organization(*) may purchase a site license at a
discount under the single-copy price. If you wish, we will send you an
invoice or site certificate for your records, either on paper or by
e-mail.

(*)By "company or other organization" is meant a single legal entity
operating under a single name at a single location, or a single
government office at a single location. Multiple branches or
subsidiaries normally need separate licenses, unless other terms are
negotiated.

A site license at the current price, as shown on the Web site
<http://oakroadsystems.com/sharware/>, entitles the licensed number of
users at your licensed location(s) to use CMP forever, both the
current release and any future releases; see "Upgrades", below. It
also gives priority in response to questions or bug reports.

As long as the total number of users does not exceed the licensed
number, you may:
  * Install CMP on more than one computer within your
    organization;
  * Make copies of CMP pursuant to your normal archival policy;
  * Allow your employees to install CMP on their home computers
    for use in the course of their employment; and
  * Allow your subcontractors, agents, and consultants to use
    CMP on computers owned by your organization at the licensed
    location(s).
    
If you need to add users after purchasing a license, you will receive
100% credit for your prior individual or site license.

You may not give copies of the registered version of CMP to
anyone outside the organization and location(s) that licensed it. Your
subcontractors, agents, and consultants may not install CMP on
their computers under your site license, but should purchase their own
or use it on your computers.

  2.3  Source Code
  
The source-code license covers one release of the source code. If you
license the source code, we will make future releases available to you
gratis or at reduced prices, depending on the extent of the changes.
This pricing will be at our sole discretion.

If you purchase a site license and also purchase source code, you pay
for just one copy of source code. You can distribute the source code
within your organization to any or all of the users covered by the
site license.

The source code is presently in ISO/ANSI C and compiles in Microsoft
Visual C/C++, but we reserve the right to change compilers or
programming languages.

If you license the source code, you may examine it and also modify and
recompile it for your own use. The modified code must bear this legend
or one substantially identical:

developed from code by Stan Brown, Oak Road Systems;
portions Copyright {YEAR} Oak Road Systems http://oakroadsystems.com

You must not sell or otherwise distribute the CMP source code or
any derivative products without our agreement in advance.

If you make a substantial improvement in the source code and offer it
to us for inclusion in the product, and we accept it, we will refund
all or a part of your license fee. The decision whether to incorporate
the changes, and the amount of refund, will be in our sole discretion.

======================================================================
3. How to Pay
======================================================================

You may pay either on line or by mailing a payment to Oak Road
Systems.

  3.1  Payment on Line
  
You may find it most convenient to pay on line by credit card or other
means (including PayPal). Please see the "buy online" links at
<http://oakroadsystems.com/sharware/>.

You can buy individual licenses or a site license. (Source code can be
purchased only directly from Oak Road Systems.) You will receive a
prompt e-mail with a secure link for downloading the code from the
Web.

(The on-line payment system is not set up to upgrade the number of
users on a site license. Please e-mail us at
sales (at) oakroadsystems (dot) com to arrange payment.)

  3.2  Direct Payment
  
To mail your payment to Oak Road Systems, please print REGISTER.TXT or
SITEREG.TXT, fill in the blanks, and enclose it with your payment.
(Make sure you are printing the file from the latest version of
CMP; see <http://oakroadsystems.com/sharware/> for version
information.) As soon as payment is received, we will e-mail you a
link to download your purchase from the Web.

If that is not convenient, we will be happy to make other reasonable
arrangements.

We can accept these forms of direct payment:
  * US currency
  * US-dollar check drawn on a US bank
  * US-dollar money order issued by a US agency
  * foreign currency (no coins, please)
    
If your check is dishonored by your bank for any reason, you agree to
make the check good and to pay the fee charged by our bank.

Sorry, non-US checks can be accepted on line only; please see "Payment
on Line" above. We can't accept non-US checks directly because local
banks charge punitive fees for converting them.

======================================================================
4. Redistributing CMP
======================================================================

You are free to distribute unmodified copies of CMP, under these
conditions:
 1. Distribute only the unregistered version. The registered version
    (file name ending RG.ZIP) and the source code (file name ending
    SR.ZIP) are for your own use only, or for the number of users
    stated in your site license.
 2. You must supply either the original ZIP file or the entire
    unpacked contents of the ZIP file. If you supply the unpacked
    contents of the ZIP file, the files for CMP must be in a
    separate subdirectory on the distribution medium.
 3. Your documentation must explain prominently that this is
    shareware, that a more recent release may be available on line,
    and that the user must purchase a registration from Oak Road
    Systems, as explained in the program documentation.
 4. The total price of a compilation (such as a CD-ROM) that includes
    CMP must be no more than US $1 per package in the
    compilation.
    
You may redistribute CMP under these terms even if you have not
registered it yourself.

======================================================================
5. Support for CMP
======================================================================

Support is available via e-mail at
support (at) oakroadsystems (dot) com. We're sorry, but at the given
fees for registration it is not economical for us to provide free
phone support. Phone support may be negotiated in advance with a site
license.

All registered users: We guarantee that we will respond to the best of
our ability, and as promptly as is reasonably possible, to all
reasonable queries from registered users.

Site licensees: Your users should feel free to e-mail questions to us
directly. It's never yet happened, but if we get a very large volume
of support queries from users at one site, we may need to ask that
site to designate one user as contact point to receive inquiries from
other users and filter out the duplicates.

Unregistered users: We intend to respond to your queries, but we will
naturally give priority to registered users.

======================================================================
6. Upgrades to CMP
======================================================================

Program upgrades are announced on our Web page
<http://oakroadsystems.com/sharware/> and to our mailing list of
registered users. As a registered user, you can choose not to receive
e-mail notices; in that case you'll want to monitor the Web page.

The evaluation version of a program upgrade can be downloaded from
<http://oakroadsystems.com/sharware/>. Registered users on our mailing
list receive a time-limited URL for downloading the registered
upgrade. If you miss the window or have chosen not to receive e-mail
notices, e-mail us your license number or the date you registered,
within 30 days of the new release, and we will e-mail it to you.

Oak Road Systems cannot be responsible for lost, bounced, or
misdirected e-mail. If you want e-mail notice of upgrades, it is your
responsibility to make sure we have a working e-mail address for you.

The user guide is sometimes updated between program releases. You can
download the new version from the Web page
<http://oakroadsystems.com/sharware/>.

For source code upgrades, please see "Source Code" above.

Suggestions for new features or other improvements will be gratefully
received and given careful consideration. When you offer suggestions,
you give Oak Road Systems full permission to make any use of them that
we see fit.

======================================================================
7. Warranty for CMP
======================================================================

We will gratefully receive defect reports related to the software or
documentation. Though we certainly intend to fix all reported bugs, we
do not guarantee to do so.

The software and documentation for CMP are offered AS IS and
WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY express or implied, including but not limited to
warranty of design, merchantability, or fitness for a particular
purpose. In no event shall we be liable for any incidental, indirect,
special, or consequential damages resulting from your use of or
inability to use the software or documentation, even if we or our
representative have been advised of the possibility of such damages.

In no event will our total liability to you for all damages, losses,
and causes of action, whether in contract, tort (including
negligence), or otherwise, exceed the amount paid by you for the
software, exclusive of handling charges, commissions, and currency
conversion fees.

======================================================================
8. Controlling Law
======================================================================

This license shall be construed in accordance with the laws of the
jurisdiction where Oak Road Systems is located at the time. Any
dispute arising out of this license shall be subject to the exclusive
jurisdiction of the courts there. (As of August 2004, Oak Road Systems
is located in Tompkins County, New York, USA.)

Any finding by a court that any provision of this license is invalid
for a particular jurisdiction shall not affect any other provision of
this license.
